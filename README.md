# Jarvis_AI
This is my attempt at building a not so much of an AI, Jarvis
## About 
This .py script uses some python modules like pyttsx3, speech_recognition, 
datetime, webbrowser, os and random module.

## Disclaimer
This is NOT an Artificial Intelligence, I have used conditionals to find, If a particular phrase exists in the speech, and then deliver particular results based on that.
